        <p>Fighting the climate crisis gives us a chance to put the well-being of people first by ensuring a right to a healthy environment. This will allow us to enhance human rights, for example by enabling more people to access cleaner and cheaper energy resources and create job opportunities in new sectors.Because we have the knowledge, power, and ability to stop climate change.</p>
        <p className='special'>Encourage climate change awareness in your community by focusing on local or regional impacts. Highlight those changes your audience might have already noticed. Because climate impacts vary, you will need to be alert for climate change impacts in your specific region. Once youâ€™ve identified a few impacts, think about how they might affect your community. Then, tie it all to climate change.</p>
